MPEG-2  Video  is  a  generic method for compressed representation of video
sequences  using  a  common  coding  syntax defined in the document ISO/IEC
13818  Part  2  by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
and  the  International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), in collaboration
with  the  International  Telecommunications  Union (ITU) as Recommendation
H.262.  The MPEG-2 concept is similar to MPEG-1, but includes extensions to
cover a wider range of applications.

The  primary  application targeted during the MPEG-2 definition process was
the  all-digital  transmission  of interlaced broadcast TV quality video at
coded  bitrates  between  4 and 9 Mbit/sec.  However, the MPEG-2 syntax has
been  found  to be efficient for other applications such as those at higher
bit rates and sample rates (e.g.  HDTV).

The  most significant enhancement over MPEG-1 is the addition of syntax for
efficient  coding  of  interlaced  video (e.g.  16x8 block sizes for motion
compensation,  field  dct  organization,  Dual  Prime  prediction,  et al).
Several  other  more  subtle  enhancements  (e.g.  10-bit DCT DC precision,
non-linear  macroblock  scale  quantizer,  intra  VLC tables, improved IDCT
mismatch  control) were adopted which have a moderate improvement in coding
efficiency....  even for progressive video sequences.

Other  key  features of MPEG-2 are the scalable extensions which permit the
division  of  a  continuous  video signal into two or more coded bitstreams
representing  the  video  at  different  resolutions (spatial scalability),
picture  quality  (SNR  scalability  and  data  partioning), or frame rates
(temporal scalability).

The  MPEG  Software  Simulation Group is currently developing MPEG software
with  the  purpose of providing aid in understanding the various algorithms
which  comprise  an encoder and decoder, and giving a sample implementation
based  on  advanced  encoding  models.   The  MPEG-2 software project is an
on-going  development.   Since  the  current version of the encoder already
employs  a  reasonable  (and  the most popular) subset of the MPEG-2 signal
coding  toolkit  (MPEG-1  and MPEG-2 Main Profile), and there appears to be
sufficient public interest, we have decided to make a public release of the
code.

The  encoder  can also be used for generating good quality constant bitrate
MPEG-1  sequences  and  is  (to our knowledge) the first publicly available
encoder based on the relatively sophisticated TM5 coding model.


mpg2ppm have been compiled and tested on the following platforms:

 - SUN SPARCstation 10, SunOS 4.1.3, (gcc compiler)
 - '386-PC, MSDOS 5.0, djgpp v1.11, gcc v2.5.7 and MS Visual C++ 4.0
 - AmigaOS (using GeekGadgets/gcc 2.95.3)

The  source code should compile without major modifications on other 32 bit
systems  with  ANSI  C  compliant  compilers.   Systems  with  16 bit 'int'
variables or segmented memory models are not supported.

Please  report  any  modifications you had to apply in order to install the
programs on your system to the address diegocr@users.sourceforge.net



Step 1: edit Makefile
---------------------

You  may have to set CC to your C compiler and CFLAGS to the flags required
by  the  compiler.   It  is  sufficient  to  set these variables in the top
directory Makefile.  They are propagated to the individual Makefiles of the
encoder  and  decoder.   Any  other  changes  have  to  be  applied  to the
individual Makefiles, however.


Step 2: edit src/config.h
----------------------------------

In  most  cases,  no  modification  should  be required.  If your C library
doesn't  accept  "rb"  / "wb" parameters in fopen() (required to disable LF
<->  CR/LF  conversion  on MSDOS systems), change the #defines RB and WB to
"r" and "w".


Step 3: make
------------

Type  'make' from the top directory.  On a PC with DJGPP installed you have
to  enter  'make  pc'  in the individual source directories to produce .exe
files.

The changes made to the original mpeg2decode source core are as follows:

 - It extract to PPM format only
 - Added methods to dump between frames/GOPs
 - Rewrited the proccess_options procedure
 - Removed the code to decode P & B frames (this speed up the program!)..
 - Added functions imp() and getime()
 - ...may others but I dont remember now ;)


Thanks to Christian Effenberger for his help.
